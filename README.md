# DISCLAIMER

This repository contains all the assignments I completed for the Data Structures course at the CSE department of NSYSU. I implemented everything in C, unless the assignment specifications required C++, to enhance my practice with pointers. Please do not copy and paste the code directly from this repository. For better learning and improvement, write and debug the code yourself.
